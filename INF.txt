Map will be generated while you move along
If player is on ground, pause, wait for action
If "w" is pressed then jump forward
"a" and "d" is side to side, only load forward
When key is pressed = move the map.

MAKE SURE THERE IS A PLATFORM FOR THEPLAYER

Movement function

"\a" plays a node

FIX Parsing of 2 integers from main to movement (both ways)
