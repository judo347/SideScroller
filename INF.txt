Map will be generated while you move along
If player is on ground, pause, wait for action
If "w" is pressed then jump forward
"a" and "d" is side to side, only load forward
When key is pressed = move the map.
"\a" plays a node


ToDo:
MAKE SURE THERE IS A PLATFORM FOR THEPLAYER
Movement function (jump) 
 - needing a pause (using sleep)
 - player now going up? WORKING ON THIS ATM
Make check and die if no playform under the player

Done:
Movement function (sideways)
FIX Parsing of 2 integers from main to movement (both ways)
